# ArduinoLightSensor-Stats
Light Sensor reading values, create a 'queued' list with 100 elements as maximum and delivering mean, median and typical deviation in time.

This repository contains 2 main files, a .ino file for Arduino and a Python file that reads the values in a list and calculates the mean, median and typical deviation of the list in real time.
